    - "Help me create an entity fixed effects regression model for the data and also do a difference in difference regression that looks at the shocks of COVID and the 2008 financial crisis on the data if the tests can be applied. Use a bunch of easily-understandable economic interpretation so we can understand the results in M3_interpretation.md. Make sure to include graphs and plots. Make sure everything is completed in the README M3.pdf and that it satisfies the rubric M3.pdf. Do not fill out the AI audit (and ignore that section on the rubric)"
    - "Yes, please do that. You may use an OCR tool"
    - "Please do so"
- AI Help:
    - Implemented the full M3 econometrics workflow and generated all requested deliverables (entity fixed effects, DiD for 2008/COVID shocks, plots, and plain-language interpretation). It also verified against the rubric
    - Added two-way FE style Model A with entity and time fixed effects plus clustered SE by entity in generate_m3_analysis.py.
    - Updated DiD to use clustered SE by entity in generate_m3_analysis.py.
    - Added diagnostics:
        - Breusch-Pagan table: m3_bp_test_results.csv
        - VIF table: m3_vif_results.csv

    - Updated README run instructions and output list in README.md.
- Human verfication:
    - We looked over the output and regressions to verify, noticed some errors, and either manually changed things or reprompted AI (disclosed in this same section). It came to our attention that the regressions did not work on the specific type of data we had, so we decided to redo the milestone with new data.

## Task: Graphing the Gap in DiD

- Files:
    - m3_treated_vs_control_gap.png
    - generate_m3_analyses.py
- AI help:
    - We told AI that we wanted another graph showing the gap between the returns and the sentiment variables based on
      m3_treated_vs_control_trends.png. It drew said graph for us. 
- Validation:
    - We looked over the graph, and it looked just like we were invisioning before prompting AI.

    - Prompt: "We want to redo M3 with new data. The old data was not panel data, so we could not run fixed effects and difference in difference regressions. Please do fixed effects and then difference in difference regressions for the lagged sentiment (x variable) and company returns from us-comp.csv. Feel free to control for various different factors (such as firm size, industry, etc.). but also do just the sentiment and firm returns. Also do an OLS regression for the entire period and also for just COVID. Make sure all requirements (except for the AI audit which I will hand write) in the README M3.pdf and rubric M3.pdf are met. Feel free to install whatever package is needed to read the pdfs. Since a previous version of M3 was attempted, differentiate the names of the new files and figures with M3v2 in the title so I can go back and delete old files from the outdated M3."
    - Prompt: "Can you create an investor-ready dashboard that summarizes M3v2. Also, can you add more M3v2 figures that show DiD and FE regressions?"
    - Propmt: "Can you expand on the economic interpreation and explain more in this file?"

- AI help:
    - Prompt: "Can you create a publication-ready comparison table just like this (in how it incrementally adds more variables to the regression) for M3v2 and the company data. Start with just the company returns and the sentiment. Then add in firm size as a variable. Then add in industry type, total debt, net sales, R&D intensity, stock price, leverage, and any other variables you feel would explain or control for the relationship. Do these variables in the order that makes the most statistical and economic sense. Also create one .png dashboard that graphs each of the regressions with some explanation. Make sure all files for M3v2 are updated accordingly."
    - Prompt: "The png dashboard is not showing up in the html dashboard. Keep a copy of the png in the reults folder, but make the png consistent with the rest of the html"
    - AI updated the interactive dashboard for M3v2, created a stepwise M3v2 company-controls regression ladder, and regenerated the outputs around it. 
- Human verification:
    - I looked over the files, and noticed that some of them were not working. I reworked them, specifically the dashboard. 

## Milestone 4

## Task: Prepping the Memo

    - memo_four_figure_dashboard.png
- AI help
    - Prompt: "Can you create an investor-ready memo that summarizes this project and our findings from M1, M2, and M3v2. Also include our failures for M3. Make sure it fits all the "Team Memo" requirements in README M4.pdf and fits the format of memo_template.pdf. Check it against the rubric M$.pdf for the team memo portion. Make sure it has a lot of economic interpretation, and can be edited so we can put our own insigths in."
    - Prompt: "Can you convert this memo to a word document that we can then edit?"
    - Prompt: "Can you take the four figures listed in the memo (Figure 1: M2 rolling correlation and lag structure; figure 2: M3v2 small vs large firm trends; Figure 3: M3v2 event study around the GFC and COVID shocks; Figure 4: M3v2 residual diagnostics) and make a dashboard that displays all four?"
    - Prompt: "I don't want an html dashboard. Just do an image or png"
- Human verification
    - We read over the suggested memo and edited it to meet our specific challenges and interpretation
    - AI created the wrong file format, so we had to correct it
    - We also converted the text file to the required pdf
